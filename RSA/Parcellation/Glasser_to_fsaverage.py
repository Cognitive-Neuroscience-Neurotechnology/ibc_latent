# I have downlaoded several files of the Glasser parcelation.
# Separately I have a file that contains the information of which Glasser parcels belong to th Frontoparietal Network.
# I want to move the Glasser atlas into fsaverage space (because my contrast maps are in fsaverage space).
# I also then want to use the Frontoparietal Network parcels in fsaverage space for my further calculations.
